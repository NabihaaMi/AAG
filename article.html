        <h1>Take a deep breath. Then thank a plant.</h1>
        <p>If you eat fruit, vegetables, grains or potatoes, thank a plant too. Plants and algae provide us with the oxygen we need to survive, as well as the carbohydrates we use for energy. They do it all through photosynthesis.</p>
       
        <h2>Photosynthesis: How Plants Make Our Oxygen and Energy</h2>
       
        <p>Photosynthesis is the process of creating sugar and oxygen from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. It happens through a long series of chemical reactions. But it can be summarized like this: Carbon dioxide, water, and light go in. Glucose, water, and oxygen come out. (Glucose is a simple sugar.)</p>
       
        <h3>The Process of Photosynthesis</h3>
        <p>Photosynthesis can be split into two processes. The “photo” part refers to reactions triggered by light. “Synthesis” — the making of the sugar — is a separate process called the Calvin cycle.</p>
       
        <h4>Inside the Chloroplast</h4>
        <p>Both processes happen inside a chloroplast. This is a specialized structure, or organelle, in a plant cell. The structure contains stacks of membranes called thylakoid membranes. That’s where the light reaction begins.</p>

        <p>Chloroplasts are found in plant cells. This is where photosynthesis takes place. The chlorophyll molecules that take in energy from sunlight are located in the stacks called thylakoid membranes.</p>

        <h3>Let the Light Shine In</h3>
        <p>When light hits a plant’s leaves, it shines on chloroplasts and into their thylakoid membranes. Those membranes are filled with chlorophyll, a green pigment. This pigment absorbs light energy. Light travels as electromagnetic waves. The wavelength — distance between waves — determines energy level. Some of those wavelengths are visible to us as the colors we see. If a molecule, such as chlorophyll, has the right shape, it can absorb the energy from some wavelengths of light.</p>
